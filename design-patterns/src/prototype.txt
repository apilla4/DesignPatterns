This pattern involves implementing a prototype interface, it creates a clone of the current object

This pattern is used when the direct creation of the object is costly. For example, say that an object is to be created after a costly database operation. We can cache the object, returns its clone on the next request, and update the database as and when it is needed, thus reducing database calls.
